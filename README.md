# NGSongInfo
A mini tool that searches songs on Newgrounds.com. Might be useful if RobTop didn't approve your songs, or that you just want to listen to that offline.
# Instructions
1. Run runGetGJSongInfo.php in a local server (Apache, Nginx, etc.) or upload to a known website
2. Type the song ID of any song, approved or not. This will return a set of data, including the download link
3. Extra: If you want to use that in Geometry Dash (Steam ver.), Go to %USERPROFILE%/AppData/Local/GeometryDash/ (or /Geometry Dash/) and copy the song out, then rename it into the song ID, plus .mp3. After that go to GD and enter the same ID then press use. Note that using such songs gurantee that users that does not have that song via NGSongInfo cannot download the song.
